Recommendations
1. More appropriate timing
The previous analysis points out that March, September, October and December had the highest success rates. Nevertheless, more data should be collected and analyzed to make sure that this seasonal effect is constant over time. 
2. Smarter marketing design
By targeting the right customers, the bank will have more and more positive responses which will prevent imbalance in the original dataset. Hence, more accurate information will be presented to the bank for improving the subscriptions. 
3. Better services provision
With a more granular understanding of its customer base, the bank has the ability to provide better banking services. For example, marital status and occupation reveal a customer's life stage while loan status indicates his/her overall risk profile.

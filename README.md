## Recommendations for the Next Marketing Campaign (Conclusion):

**1. More appropriate timing**

When implementing a marketing strategy, external factors, such as the time of calling, should also be carefully considered. The previous analysis points out that March, September, October and December had the highest success rates. Nevertheless, more data should be collected and analyzed to make sure that this seasonal effect is constant over time. If the trend has the potential to continue in the future, the bank should consider initiating its telemarketing campaign in fall and spring. 

**2. Smarter marketing design**

By targeting the right customers, the bank will have more and more positive responses, and the classification algorithms would ultimately eliminate the imbalance in the original dataset. Hence, more accurate information will be presented to the bank for improving the subscriptions. Meanwhile, to increase the likelihood of subscription, the bank should re-evaluate the content and design of its current campaign, making it more appealing to its target customers. 

**3. Better services provision**

With a more granular understanding of its customer base, the bank has the ability to provide better banking services.
For example, marital status and occupation reveal a customer's life stage while loan status indicates his/her overall risk profile. With this information, the bank can estimate when a customer might need to make an investment. In this way, the bank can better satisfy its customer demand by providing banking services for the right customer at the right time.
